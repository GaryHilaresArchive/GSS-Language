# C++ Style Guide
## Casing
### Namespaces
Pascal Case.
### Classes
Pascal Case.
### Enums
Do not use plain enums. Use enum classes. If needed, they must be in Pascal Case.
### Enum Classes
Pascal Case.
### Typenames
Pascal Case.
### Functions and methods
Camel Case.
### Variables
Snake Case.
### Braces
#### For functions and methods
For getters and setters in the same line. For any other in the next line.
#### For if/else if/else/while/do while
One-liners go without braces in the next line. Others go with braces in the next line.

## File naming
Pascal case.
C source files must end in `.c` and C header files must end in `.h`.
C++ source files must end in `.cpp` and C++ header files must end in `.hpp`.

## Extensions
Do not use compiler extensions. They make the code not portable.
